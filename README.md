# Tiny MD Vditor

A tiny local markdown editor.

It is just an editor, for those who only want to open a file and start writing, without worrying about concepts of workspace.

Technically this is a trivial wrapper around the powerful [vditor](https://github.com/Vanessa219/vditor). One should use their execellent full-featured offical [local app](https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan) for complex projects.
